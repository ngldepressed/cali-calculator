    <article>
        <p>The Front Lever is that move. You’ve seen it. Some shredded dude grabs a bar, leans back, and just hangs there like gravity forgot about him. Straight body. No shaking. No drama. It looks illegal.</p>
        
        <p>And here you are swinging your legs like you’re trying to start a lawnmower. Let’s be honest: most people fail at the Front Lever because they train it like idiots. They jump straight to advanced progressions, hold a sloppy tuck for 4 seconds, post it on Instagram, and wonder why their elbows feel like shattered glass two weeks later.</p>

        <blockquote>Hope is not a training program. Mechanical tension is.</blockquote>

        <div class="ego-check">
            <h2>Ego Check (Yeah, This Is About You)</h2>
            <p>If you can’t hold a clean tucked front lever for 20 seconds, you have zero business trying the full version. Not 8 seconds. Not 12 seconds with your back rounded like a scared cat. <strong>Twenty. Clean. Seconds.</strong></p>
            <p>If you skip this step, you’re not being ambitious. You’re being reckless. The distal bicep tendon doesn’t care about your ambition. It will happily explode anyway. Build the damn base.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why the Front Lever Is a Physics Nightmare</h2>
        <p>Here’s what you’re actually fighting: Your shoulders are the pivot. Your entire body is a long, heavy plank. Gravity is pulling your legs down like it owes them money. The farther your legs are from your shoulders, the heavier they become. It’s not linear. It’s brutal.</p>
        
        <p>This is why the move feels impossible when you extend your legs. You didn’t suddenly get weaker — you just increased the leverage and turned your body into a longer crowbar. And here’s the part most people screw up: This is a <strong>straight-arm movement</strong>. Your elbows are locked. Your lats don’t get help from your biceps. Your scapula has to retract and depress hard enough to keep your torso from sagging.</p>

        <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #222; margin: 40px 0;">

        <h2>1. Weighted Pull-Ups: The Foundation of Everything</h2>
        <p>If you suck at weighted pull-ups, you’re not ready for a front lever. Period. Bodyweight pull-ups for 20 reps are cute. They don’t build the raw pulling power you need. The front lever demands density — thick, stubborn lat strength.</p>

        <h3>The Gold Standard</h3>
        <p>You want a target? <strong>5 sets of 5 reps with +20kg (45 lbs)</strong>. Or roughly 25–30% of your bodyweight added for clean reps. If you can do that, your tucked front lever will feel like cheating.</p>

        <h3>Do Them Properly</h3>
        <p>No half reps. No chin barely grazing the bar. No kipping like you’re at a CrossFit audition. Chin over bar. Chest toward bar. Squeeze like you’re trying to bend the bar in half. That squeeze at the top? <strong>That’s front lever strength.</strong></p>

        <h2>2. Straight-Arm Lat Pulldowns: The Isolation You Hate</h2>
        <p>The front lever is straight-arm. So why do most people only train bent-arm pulling? Because isolation work isn’t sexy. Too bad. The straight-arm lat pulldown teaches you how to engage your lats without bending your elbows. That’s the entire skill.</p>

        <p>Lock your arms. Slight hinge at the hips. Pull the bar from overhead all the way to your thighs. <strong>Hold it for 2 seconds at the bottom.</strong> If your elbows bend, you’re cheating. If you feel it in your triceps, reset. Focus on your armpits. Imagine crushing something inside them.</p>

        <h2>3. Front Lever Raises: Where Reality Hits</h2>
        <p>This is where you earn it. Front lever raises are the bridge between strength and skill. You start in a dead hang and raise your body into a horizontal position with straight arms. The first time you try these, you will look like you’re being electrocuted. Good. That means you’re actually training.</p>

        <h3>Progressions (Don’t Skip Them)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tucked Raises:</strong> Knees tight to chest. Pull hips up until back is parallel to ground. Lower slowly.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Tuck:</strong> Push the knees slightly away from your chest. Instantly harder.</li>
            <li><strong>One Leg Out:</strong> One leg straight, one tucked. Switch each set. This is the bridge to full.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="highlight">The Secret Cue:</span> Stop thinking about “lifting your legs.” Think about <strong>pushing the bar away from you.</strong> The harder you drive the bar forward, the more your body naturally pivots into position.</p>

        <h2>The “Lever Killer” Routine</h2>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Exercise</th>
                    <th>Sets/Reps</th>
                    <th>Rest</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Weighted Pull-Ups</td>
                    <td>5 x 5 (Heavy)</td>
                    <td>3 Minutes</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Front Lever Raises</td>
                    <td>4 x 6–8 (Clean)</td>
                    <td>2 Minutes</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Straight-Arm Pulldowns</td>
                    <td>3 x 12–15</td>
                    <td>90 Seconds</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Tucked Lever Hold</td>
                    <td>3 x Max Clean Hold</td>
                    <td>60 Seconds</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>The Stuff Nobody Wants to Hear</h2>
        <p><strong>Body Fat Matters:</strong> If you’re sitting at 20% body fat, every extra pound on your legs is another pound your lats have to hold horizontally. If you want the front lever to look effortless, aim for around 10–12% body fat.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Tendons Adapt Slower Than Muscles:</strong> Your muscles get stronger fast. Your tendons do not. You might feel ready for harder progressions in 3 weeks. Your connective tissue is still filing paperwork. If you feel a sharp “twinge,” stop. Three weeks off beats six months of rehab.</p>

        <p>Get brutally strong at weighted pull-ups. Own straight-arm strength. Progress your lever raises patiently. Stay lean. Respect your tendons. Do that consistently for 6–12 months and the front lever stops being some mystical calisthenics trick.</p>
