        <h1>The Best Pushup You’re Not Doing (And Why Your Planche Still Sucks)</h1>
        <p><em style="color: #666;">By the CaliCalculator Crew • 2026</em></p>

    <article>
        <p>Let’s get this straight. The Planche isn’t unlocked by doing 100 cute little pushups before bed. You can crank out pushups until your chest is pumped and your ego feels huge — and you’ll still faceplant the second you try to lean forward into a tuck.</p>
        
        <p>Why? Because standard pushups don’t teach you how to own the lean. If you want a Planche, stop training like a dude chasing a chest pump and start training like someone who respects physics. Enter: <strong>Pseudo Planche Pushups (PPPP)</strong>.</p>

        <div class="ego-box">
            <h2>First: Your Wrists Are Weak. Admit It.</h2>
            <p>Planche work punishes stiff wrists. If you don’t warm them up for at least 10 minutes, you’re not hardcore — you’re stupid. You’ll be shaking your hand after sets and pretending it’s fine. It’s not fine. Do wrist circles. Palm leans. Finger pulses. Or use parallettes if your floor mobility is trash.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why the Lean Is Everything</h2>
        <p>In a normal pushup, your hands are under your shoulders and life is easy. In a Planche, your hands are near your hips and gravity is trying to slam your face into the floor. The Pseudo Planche Pushup forces you to lean forward while you press. The more you lean, the longer the lever. The longer the lever, the heavier your body becomes. At max lean, your shoulders feel like they’re benching a small car.</p>

        <h3>What It Actually Trains</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anterior Delts:</strong> If these aren’t burning, you’re not leaning enough.</li>
            <li><strong>Biceps Tendons:</strong> They stabilize in straight-arm work. Weak here = elbow pain later.</li>
            <li><strong>Serratus Anterior:</strong> The “rounded upper back” muscle. No protraction? No Planche.</li>
            <li><strong>Upper Chest + Triceps:</strong> They help you press out of the hole.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Most of You Are Cheating</h2>
        <p>Here’s what happens: You lean forward. You do one hard rep. It gets tough. You slowly shift your weight back without realizing it. Now you’re just doing a weird-looking regular pushup. If you shift back, the rep doesn’t count. I don’t care how many you did. <strong>The lean stays. Or the set is over.</strong> Comfort doesn’t build Planche strength.</p>

        <h2>How To Actually Do It Right</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Protract first:</strong> Push the floor away. Upper back rounded like a turtle shell. If your back flattens, you lost tension.</li>
            <li><strong>Lean like you mean it:</strong> Shoulders forward. Way forward. If it feels scary, you’re probably finally doing it right.</li>
            <li><strong>External rotation:</strong> Turn your hands out slightly (45°). Your wrists will thank you.</li>
            <li><strong>Full range:</strong> Chest close to floor. Press back up. Lock the elbows. No soft, half-bent nonsense.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><span class="highlight">The Cue:</span> Imagine you’re trying to push your hands down toward your feet while pressing. That keeps you from drifting backward into comfort.</p>

        <h2>Sets and Reps (Don’t Be an Idiot)</h2>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Training Type</th>
                    <th>Sets</th>
                    <th>Reps</th>
                    <th>Rest</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Raw Strength</strong></td>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>3–5 (Max Lean)</td>
                    <td>3–5 Mins</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Hypertrophy</strong></td>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>8–10 (Moderate)</td>
                    <td>2 Mins</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><em>Frequency: 2–3 times per week. Recover like you actually care about your joints.</em></p>

        <h2>Reality Check: This Alone Won’t Give You a Planche</h2>
        <p>PPPP is bent-arm. The Planche is straight-arm. You can be a monster at PPPP and still fail your tuck because your straight-arm scapular strength sucks. You need a hierarchy: <strong>Static Holds → Planche Leans → PPPP (Dynamic)</strong>. That’s how carryover works.</p>

        <h2>Form Checklist (No Excuses)</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Hollow body. No sagging lower back. Squeeze glutes.</li>
            <li>Point your toes. Yes, it matters. It shifts weight forward.</li>
            <li>Elbow pits forward. Lock the joint properly.</li>
            <li>If protraction dies or elbows bend during a lean, <strong>the set is over.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Word</h2>
        <p>The Planche takes years. Not weeks. Not one summer cut. If you rush the lean, your elbows will light up so badly you won’t be able to twist open a water bottle. Stay lean. Stay patient. Stay consistent. And when you do your Pseudo Planche Pushups? Lean as far forward as you possibly can. Gravity doesn’t care about your ego. But it respects leverage.</p>
