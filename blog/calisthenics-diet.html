    <article>
        <p>If you listen to gym bros, they’ll tell you to "bulk until you hate yourself" and then cut. In calisthenics, that is a fast track to losing your Front Lever and blowing out your tendons. You aren't a powerlifter; you are a bodyweight athlete. Every pound of fat you put on is <strong>dead weight</strong> that makes your goals move further away.</p>

        <div class="dead-weight">
            <strong>The 15% Rule:</strong> If you are over 15% body fat, you are carrying a "weighted vest" of useless lard that you can't take off. You want to unlock the Planche? Try doing it with a 5kg bag of flour strapped to your lower back. That’s what being fat feels like to your shoulders.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Step 1: Get to 12% and Stay There</h2>
        <p>The "Sweet Spot" for calisthenics is <span class="highlight">10% to 12% body fat</span>. At this level, you are lean enough to see your abs and, more importantly, lean enough that your strength-to-weight ratio is optimized. If you’re at 20% right now, stop worrying about "gaining size" and start cutting. You’ll find that as the weight drops, skills you’ve been struggling with for months suddenly become easy.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: The "Slow-Cook" Recomp</h2>
        <p>Once you hit that 12% mark, don't go on a 5,000-calorie "dirty bulk." That’s how you get soft and slow. Instead, eat at <span class="highlight">maintenance calories</span> or a very slight surplus (200 calories max). Your goal is to "recomp"—slowly replacing fat with dense, functional muscle while keeping your weight stable. This is how you gain <strong>relative strength</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: What to Actually Eat</h2>
        <p>Recomping isn't just about calories; it's about what those calories do. To stay at 12% body fat while building elite strength, follow this breakdown:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protein is Non-Negotiable:</strong> Aim for 1.6g to 2g of protein per kg of bodyweight. This keeps your muscle mass intact while you're leaning out.</li>
            <li><strong>Carbs are Training Fuel:</strong> Don't go "Keto." You need glycogen for explosive pull-ups. Eat your carbs (oats, rice, potatoes) around your workout window.</li>
            <li><strong>Fats for Hormones:</strong> Keep your healthy fats moderate. They are calorie-dense, and it's easy to accidentally "bulk" if you overdo them.</li>
        </ul>

       <h2>Step 4: The Math of Relative Strength</h2>
        <p>In this sport, we want "compact" power. You need the strength of a gorilla but the weight of a gymnast. Strength in calisthenics is a simple fraction:</p>
        
        <div class="math-container">
            <span>Relative Strength =</span>
            <div class="fraction">
                <span class="numerator">Absolute Strength</span>
                <span class="denominator">Bodyweight</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>If you increase your strength by 10% but also increase your bodyweight by 10% through a "dirty bulk," your relative strength remains the <strong>exact same</strong>. You haven't actually gotten any better at moving your body; you've just gotten heavier. This is why the slow recomp is the only logical choice for skill-based athletes.</p>

        <h2>The Reality Check</h2>
        <p>Look at the elite guys. They don't look like 120kg bodybuilders. They look lean, wiry, and explosive. They’ve spent years at a stable weight, slowly refining their muscle quality. Stop the "yo-yo" dieting. Get lean, stay lean, and let the strength come over time. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.</p>

        <div style="background: #111; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498db;">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Track your <strong>Relative Strength Ratio</strong> on our homepage calculator. If that number is going up, you're winning—regardless of what the scale says.
