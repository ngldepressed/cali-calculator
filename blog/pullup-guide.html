    <h1>From Thick Pipes to Weighted Sets: A Roadmap to Your First Pull-up</h1>
    
    <p>Many people start their journey on standard gym equipment, but my foundation was built on something much harder. My father built my first pull-up bar at home using <span class="highlight">thick industrial pipes</span>. In biomechanical terms, the increased diameter moved the load away from my lats and forced my forearms and grip to work at 200% capacity.</p>

    <div class="stats-box">
        "Every back exercise was harder on it. I started with negatives on chin-ups, eventually hitting 10-15 reps, and even progressed to weighted sets with +15kg for 6 months."
    </div>

    <h2>The "Chin-up vs. Pull-up" Paradox</h2>
    <p>A common mistake is assuming that Chin-ups (supinated grip) transfer 1:1 to Pull-ups (pronated grip). After hitting 15kg weighted chin-ups, I dropped them to chase the Planche. To my surprise, I could barely do 1 or 2 pull-ups with terrible form once I returned to the bar.</p>
    
    <div class="tech-note">
        <strong>Biotech Insight:</strong> Chin-ups rely heavily on the Biceps Brachii and Pectoralis Major. Pull-ups shift the mechanical advantage to the Lower Trapezius and Brachialis. If you stop back training for months to focus on skills like the Planche, your neurological "pulling" patterns will fade.
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>My Critical Warning:</strong> I stopped doing back exercises for 3 months because I really wanted to unlock the Planche. I was training it every single day. <span class="highlight">I do not recommend you drop your pull exercises completely like I did.</span> Even if your Planche work is stressful, you should keep your pull sessions at least twice a week—perhaps with lower intensity—but do not drop them entirely. The "transfer" isn't as clean as you'd think.
    </div>

    <h2>The Scientific Progression Path</h2>
    <p>If you are stuck at zero, stop doing "random" back work. The only way to get good at a specific exercise is to perform easier versions of that specific movement pattern (Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands).</p>

    <h3>1. Negatives and Band Assistance</h3>
    <p>Start with <span class="highlight">Negatives</span>. Jump to the top of the bar and fight the descent for 5-10 seconds. Once you move to bands, choose the thickest one first. As you get stronger, move to thinner bands until you don't need one at all. It’s a boring process, but it is the most effective way to build the neuromuscular connection.</p>

    <h3>2. Australian Pull-ups vs. Specificity</h3>
    <p>Some people will tell you to do Australian (horizontal) pull-ups. While they are good and you should do them, the only way to master the vertical pull is to train the vertical pattern. Start doing easier progressions of the pull-up itself.</p>

    <h3>3. The "Rule of 5x5"</h3>
    <p>Once you unlock that first rep, your goal is volume. Follow this ladder:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Achieve 3 sets of 3 reps.</li>
        <li>Progress to 3 sets of 5 reps.</li>
        <li>Final Goal: <span class="highlight">5 sets of 5 reps</span> with clean form.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advancing to Weighted Loads</h2>
    <p>After you can hit sets of 10, or a solid 5x5, you have a choice: go for high reps (3x10) or start adding weight. If you want true strength, <span class="highlight">add weight</span>. Start small—just 1 or 2 kg. Increase the load every 4 weeks or when you can easily hit your sets with 2 or 3 reps left in reserve (RPE 7-8).</p>

        "Mastering the pull-up is about mastering physics. Whether you are training on thick pipes or a pro-park, the consistency in the progression is the only variable that matters."
