        <h1>Stop Lying to Yourself: Why You Need to Add Weight</h1>

        <div class="truth-bomb">
            If you’ve been doing "sets of 50" pushups for six months and you still look like a stick, you aren’t training—you’re just exercising. Stop hiding behind high reps because you're scared of heavy weight.
        </div>

        <p>Let's be real: there’s a weird "purest" ego in calisthenics. Guys think that if they touch a weight plate, they’ve lost their "bodyweight soul." That's total BS. Your muscles don't give a damn if the resistance comes from a $500 vest or a rusty bucket of rocks. They only care about <strong>mechanical tension</strong>. If you want to get jacked, you have to make things harder, not just longer.</p>

        <h2>1. The "High Rep" Trap</h2>
        <p>Doing 30 pull-ups is cool for a party trick, but it’s mostly just cardio for your lats. Once you can clear 15 clean reps, you've mastered your bodyweight. To keep growing, you have to shock the system. Adding 10kg to your waist is a better way to build a thick back than doing 100 shitty, half-range reps that just hurt your elbows.</p>

        <h2>2. Build Density, Not Just "Inflated" Muscle</h2>
        <p>You know those guys who look big but can’t move? That’s not what we’re doing here. Weighted calisthenics builds <strong>dense, functional power</strong>. It forces your tendons to thicken up so you don't snap like a twig when you try a Planche or a Front Lever. If you want that "statue" look, you need to move heavy stuff.</p>

        <h2>3. Don't Be a Pussy With the Numbers</h2>
        <p>The best thing about weighted training? You can't lie to yourself. You either pulled the 20kg or you didn't. With bodyweight, people cheat their form when they get tired. They stop halfway, they swing their legs, they cope. When there’s a plate hanging between your legs, you have to be honest.</p>

        <div class="routine">
            <h2>The "Stop Being Small" Workout</h2>
            <p>Do this twice a week. If it feels easy, you aren't using enough weight.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weighted Pull-ups:</strong> 5 sets of 5 (Heavy as hell).</li>
                <li><strong>Weighted Dips:</strong> 3 sets of 8 (Deep as possible, feel the chest stretch).</li>
                <li><strong>Weighted Push-ups:</strong> 3 sets of 12 (Put a plate on your back and stay flat).</li>
                <li><strong>Standard Chin-ups:</strong> 2 sets until your arms literally quit.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3 Ways People Screw This Up</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Ego Lifting:</strong> Don't throw 40kg on your first day. You'll blow out a shoulder and be back on the couch for three months. Add weight slowly. 2kg a week is plenty.</p>
        <p><strong>2. The "Chicken Wing":</strong> If your form looks like a dying bird because the weight is too heavy, take some off. Keep it clean or it doesn't count.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Skipping the Basics:</strong> Don't forget how to move your own body. Do some unweighted sets to keep that "flow" and explosive power.</p>

        <p>Bottom line: Stop chasing reps. Start chasing weight. That’s how you get the body that actually matches your strength.</p>
