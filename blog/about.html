    <h1>About Cali Biotech</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the <span class="highlight">Cali-Biotech Command Center</span>. This project was born out of a simple realization: Calisthenics is as much a science as it is a sport.</p>

    <div class="bio-box">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Most fitness apps give generic advice. We aim to provide <span class="highlight">biomechanical precision</span>. By using variables like height, weight, and torque factors, our tools help athletes understand exactly where they stand in their journey toward elite skills like the Planche, Front Lever, and Muscle-up.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Who is behind this?</h2>
    <p>I am a calisthenics enthusiast and developer dedicated to bringing data-driven training to the street workout community. I believe that by measuring our "Weighted Matrix" and "CNS Readiness," we can train smarter and avoid the injuries that often plague bodyweight athletes.</p>

    <h2>Why "Biotech"?</h2>
    <p>We treat the human body as a biological machine. Every pull-up and dip is a lever-based movement influenced by physics. Cali-Biotech is here to help you optimize those levers.</p>
