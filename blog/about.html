    <h1>About Cali Biotech</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the <span class="highlight">Cali-Biotech Command Center</span>. This project was born out of a simple realization: Calisthenics is as much a science as it is a sport.</p>

    <div class="vision-card">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Most fitness applications offer generic advice that fails to account for individual body types. We aim to provide <strong>biomechanical precision</strong>. By utilizing allometric scaling and torque constants, our tools help athletes understand exactly where they stand in their journey toward elite skills like the Planche, Front Lever, and Iron Cross.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Who is behind this?</h2>
    <p>I am a calisthenics enthusiast and developer dedicated to bringing data-driven training to the street workout community. I believe that by measuring our <strong>"Weighted Matrix"</strong> and <strong>"CNS Readiness,"</strong> we can train smarter and avoid the injuries that often plague bodyweight athletes.</p>

    <h2>Why "Biotech"?</h2>
    <p>We treat the human body as a biological machine. Every pull-up, dip, and lever is a movement influenced by the laws of physics. Cali-Biotech is engineered to help you optimize those levers, providing a bridge between raw strength and technical mastery.</p>
