        <h1>5 Beginner Skills to Unlock Your Calisthenics Journey</h1>

    <article>
        <p>Seeing athletes perform a Full Planche or a Victorian Cross is inspiring, but you can't build a house without a foundation. Before you fly, you have to crawl. These 5 skills are the "entry-level" statics that build the core strength and balance needed for elite movements.</p>

        <h2>1. Crow Pose (Bakasana)</h2>
        <p>The Crow Pose is usually the first balance skill anyone learns. It teaches you how to use your hands as "brakes" and how to shift your weight forward. It builds the wrist strength required for everything else on this list.</p>
        <p class="tech-data">> PRIMARY TARGET: Wrist Extensors, Anterior Deltoids, Hip Flexors.</p>
        <div class="success-box">
            <strong>Goal:</strong> Hold for 30 seconds before moving to the Handstand.
        </div>

        <h2>2. L-Sit</h2>
        <p>The L-Sit is the king of core compression. It requires you to push down through your triceps while pulling your knees to your chest with your abs. It can be done on the floor, parallettes, or pull-up bars.</p>
        <p class="tech-data">> PRIMARY TARGET: Rectus Abdominis, Iliopsoas (Hip Flexors), Triceps Brachii.</p>

        

        <h2>3. Elbow Lever (Elbow Hold)</h2>
        <p>This is often called a "cheat" skill because it relies more on balance than raw strength. By digging your elbows into your stomach/hips, you create a shelf for your body. It’s a great way to build the "horizontal" muscle memory used in the Planche.</p>
        <p class="tech-data">> PRIMARY TARGET: Spinal Erectors, Core Stability, Wrist Flexibility.</p>

        <h2>4. Tuck Front Lever</h2>
        <p>Before you can hold a straight-body front lever, you must master the tuck. This builds the initial "pulling" power in your lats and teaches you how to keep your arms locked straight while under tension.</p>
        <p class="tech-data">> PRIMARY TARGET: Latissimus Dorsi, Posterior Deltoid, Scapular Retractors.</p>

        <h2>5. Tuck Planche</h2>
        <p>The Tuck Planche is the first real step toward the ultimate pushing skill. Unlike the Crow Pose, your knees are NOT resting on your arms. You are using pure shoulder protraction to stay airborne. It’s a wake-up call for your anterior delts.</p>
        <p class="tech-data">> PRIMARY TARGET: Serratus Anterior, Anterior Deltoid, Upper Pectoralis.</p>

        <div class="success-box">
            <strong>Training Tip:</strong> Practice these at the <strong>beginning</strong> of your workout when your nervous system is fresh. Skills require focus, not just fatigue!
        </div>

        <section class="faq-section">
            <h2 style="border:none;">Beginner Skills FAQ</h2>
            
            <span class="faq-q">How many days a week should I practice skills?</span>
            <p>For beginners, 3 days a week is plenty. Skill training is hard on the central nervous system (CNS) and your tendons. Give your joints time to adapt.</p>

            <span class="faq-q">Why do my wrists hurt during Crow Pose?</span>
            <p>Your wrists aren't used to supporting your full body weight yet. Make sure to warm them up with circles and stretches for 5 minutes before you start. Use parallettes if the floor is too painful.</p>

            <span class="faq-q">Can I learn these without being able to do pull-ups?</span>
            <p>You can start Crow Pose and Elbow Levers immediately. However, for the Tuck Front Lever, we recommend being able to do at least 5 clean pull-ups first.</p>

            <span class="faq-q">How long should I hold a skill before moving to the next level?</span>
            <p>A "solid" hold is usually 15-20 seconds with perfect form. Once you hit that mark consistently, you are ready for the "Advanced Tuck" variations.</p>
