        <p>Seeing athletes perform a Full Planche or a Victorian Cross is inspiring, but you can't build a house without a foundation. Before you fly, you have to crawl. These 5 skills are the "entry-level" statics that build the core strength and balance needed for elite movements.</p>

        <h2>1. Crow Pose (Bakasana)</h2>
        <p>The Crow Pose is usually the first balance skill anyone learns. It teaches you how to use your hands as "brakes" and how to shift your weight forward. It builds the wrist strength required for everything else on this list.</p>
        <div class="success-box">
            <strong>Goal:</strong> Hold for 30 seconds before moving to the Handstand.
        </div>

        <h2>2. L-Sit</h2>
        <p>The L-Sit is the king of core compression. It requires you to push down through your triceps while pulling your knees to your chest with your abs. It can be done on the floor, parallettes, or pull-up bars.</p>

        <h2>3. Elbow Lever (Elbow Hold)</h2>
        <p>This is often called a "cheat" skill because it relies more on balance than raw strength. By digging your elbows into your stomach/hips, you create a shelf for your body. It’s a great way to build the "horizontal" muscle memory used in the Planche.</p>

        <h2>4. Tuck Front Lever</h2>
        <p>Before you can hold a straight-body front lever, you must master the tuck. This builds the initial "pulling" power in your lats and teaches you how to keep your arms locked straight while under tension.</p>

        <h2>5. Tuck Planche</h2>
        <p>The Tuck Planche is the first real step toward the ultimate pushing skill. Unlike the Crow Pose, your knees are NOT resting on your arms. You are using pure shoulder protraction to stay airborne. It’s a wake-up call for your anterior delts.</p>

        <div class="success-box">
            <strong>Training Tip:</strong> Practice these at the <strong>beginning</strong> of your workout when your nervous system is fresh. Skills require focus, not just fatigue!
