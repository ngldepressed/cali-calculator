        <p>Most people think high-level calisthenics takes years of grinding. While the <em>Full</em> Planche does, many "elite-looking" skills can actually be unlocked in just 2 to 3 months if you already have a solid foundation of basic strength.</p>

        <p>If you have your basic pull-ups and dips down, here is how to fast-track your way to the big leagues.</p>

        <h2>1. Muscle-Ups</h2>
        <p>If you have a strong pull-up foundation (12+ clean reps), the Muscle-up is more about technique than power. You can easily unlock this in 8 weeks by practicing with <strong>resistance bands</strong>. The bands help you learn the "transition" from the pull to the dip. Gradually use thinner bands until you're flying over the bar on your own.</p>

        <h2>2. Tuck Planche</h2>
        <p>The Tuck Planche is the gateway to all pushing skills. By focusing on shoulder protraction and leaning forward every session, you can move from a simple Crow Pose to a solid Tuck Planche in about 10 weeks. Consistency is the only requirement here.</p>

        <h2>3. Advanced Tuck Front Lever</h2>
        <p>Once you can hold a standard Tuck Front Lever for 20 seconds, the "Advanced" version (straight back, knees moved away from chest) is the next stop. This build massive lat density. With 3 sessions a week focusing on "active pulling," 12 weeks is more than enough time to see a flat-back hold.</p>

        <h2>4. Handstand Holds</h2>
        <p>The Handstand is 50% strength and 50% balance. By practicing against a wall for the first 4 weeks to build shoulder endurance, and then moving to free-standing attempts, most athletes can find their "balance point" and hold for 5-10 seconds within a 12-week window.</p>

        <div class="timeline-box">
            <strong>The Strategy:</strong> Don't try to learn all of these at once. Pick <strong>two</strong> (one push, one pull) and dedicate the first 20 minutes of every workout to them.
