    <article>
        <p>Most people think high-level calisthenics takes years of grinding. While the <em>Full</em> Planche does, many "elite-looking" skills can actually be unlocked in just 2 to 3 months if you already have a solid foundation of basic strength.</p>

        <p>If you have your basic pull-ups and dips down, here is how to fast-track your way to the big leagues.</p>

        <h2>1. Muscle-Ups</h2>
        <p>If you have a strong pull-up foundation (12+ clean reps), the Muscle-up is more about technique than power. You can easily unlock this in 8 weeks by practicing with <strong>resistance bands</strong>. The bands help you learn the "transition" from the pull to the dip. Gradually use thinner bands until you're flying over the bar on your own.</p>
        <p class="tech-data">> PHASE 1 (Weeks 1-4): Explosive chest-to-bar pull-ups + Banded transitions.<br>> PHASE 2 (Weeks 5-8): Negative muscle-ups + decreasing band tension.</p>

        <h2>2. Tuck Planche</h2>
        <p>The Tuck Planche is the gateway to all pushing skills. By focusing on shoulder protraction and leaning forward every session, you can move from a simple Crow Pose to a solid Tuck Planche in about 10 weeks. Consistency is the only requirement here.</p>
        <p class="tech-data">> PHASE 1 (Weeks 1-4): Planche leans + Crow Pose holds.<br>> PHASE 2 (Weeks 5-10): Tuck Planche attempts (aiming for 5s intervals).</p>

        <h2>3. Advanced Tuck Front Lever</h2>
        <p>Once you can hold a standard Tuck Front Lever for 20 seconds, the "Advanced" version (straight back, knees moved away from chest) is the next stop. This build massive lat density. With 3 sessions a week focusing on "active pulling," 12 weeks is more than enough time to see a flat-back hold.</p>
        <p class="tech-data">> PHASE 1 (Weeks 1-6): Scapular pulls + 20s Tuck holds.<br>> PHASE 2 (Weeks 7-12): One-leg extensions + Advanced Tuck eccentric lowers.</p>

        <h2>4. Handstand Holds</h2>
        <p>The Handstand is 50% strength and 50% balance. By practicing against a wall for the first 4 weeks to build shoulder endurance, and then moving to free-standing attempts, most athletes can find their "balance point" and hold for 5-10 seconds within a 12-week window.</p>
        <p class="tech-data">> PHASE 1 (Weeks 1-4): Wall walks + 60s Chest-to-wall holds.<br>> PHASE 2 (Weeks 5-12): Kick-up practice + Shoulder tapping drills.</p>

        <div class="timeline-box">
            <strong>The Strategy:</strong> Don't try to learn all of these at once. Pick <strong>two</strong> (one push, one pull) and dedicate the first 20 minutes of every workout to them.

            <h2 style="border:none; margin-top:0;">Skill Progression FAQ</h2>
            
            <span class="faq-q">What is the "Foundation" strength required?</span>
            <p>Before attempting this 8-12 week track, you should be able to do at least 10 clean pull-ups, 15 dips, and a 45-second plank. Without this, your tendons won't be ready for the load.</p>

            <span class="faq-q">Can I train skills every day?</span>
            <p>No. Skills like the Planche and Front Lever are extremely taxing on the elbows and shoulders. Train them 3-4 times a week maximum, leaving at least 24 hours between sessions for recovery.</p>

            <span class="faq-q">Why am I not seeing progress after 4 weeks?</span>
            <p>Calisthenics progress isn't linear. You might feel "stuck" for 3 weeks and then suddenly unlock the skill on Week 4. Stick to the program; your nervous system is adapting behind the scenes.</p>

            <span class="faq-q">Should I use chalk for these skills?</span>
            <p>For Muscle-ups and Front Levers, chalk is a game changer. It prevents your grip from being the "weak link," allowing you to focus 100% on the pull.</p>
