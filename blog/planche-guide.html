        <h1>Unlock the Planche: Why Dips Aren't Enough</h1>
        <p><em style="color: #888;">By CaliCalculator Team • February 2026</em></p>
    </header>

    <article>
        <p>The Planche is a high-level skill that is all about <strong>straight-arm strength</strong> and shoulder dominance. Don't get me wrong—get absolutely strong in the basics. Dips and push-ups are the bread and butter of strength, but they will not unlock the planche on their own. To reach the next level, you must transition to specific straight-arm training.</p>

        <p class="tech-box">> CALCULATION: In a full planche, the anterior deltoid must generate enough torque to counter the entire weight of the lower body acting on a ~1-meter lever arm. This is why bent-arm strength (dips) rarely transfers 1:1.</p>

        <h2>The Golden Rule: Warmup First</h2>
        <p>Before we dive into the exercises, you must understand that planche training puts immense pressure on the wrists and the biceps tendon. Never start these drills "cold." Spend at least 10 minutes on wrist circles, finger-pulses, and light bicep curls to get blood into the joints.</p>

        <h2>1. Planche Leans (The Ultimate Transfer)</h2>
        <p>Planche leans are the most transferable exercise because they force your shoulders and tendons to work through the exact motion of the planche, just with less intensity. They are absolutely brutal on the anterior deltoids.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Key: Scapular Protraction.</strong> You must push the floor away and round your upper back. If your shoulder blades are "pinched" together, you aren't doing a planche—you're just falling forward.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How to Overload:</strong> Lean further forward until your hands are near your hips. </li>
            <li><strong>Progression:</strong> Once you reach a deep lean, add a weighted vest or a backpack to increase the load.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Rings Warning:</strong> Planche leans can be done on rings, but be warned: they are <strong>extremely brutal</strong> on the joints. Master the floor first.
        </div>

        <h2>2. Zanetti Press / Straight-Arm DB Raises</h2>
        <p>After your leans, this is the king of accessory movements. If you can build up to a <strong>30kg raise</strong> with locked elbows, you are significantly closer to the planche. This exercise builds the "stopping power" in your shoulders.</p>
        <div class="pro-tip">
            <strong>The Routine:</strong> Try 2 to 3 sets of these after your planche leans. Focus on pure straight-arm tension. If you bend your elbows even slightly, the weight is too heavy.
        </div>
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Tendon Health:</strong> This move is very taxing on the elbows. If your joints feel "sketchy," drop the weight immediately. Longevity beats a 1-week PR.
        </div>

        <h2>3. Specificity: Practicing the Movement</h2>
        <p>You can do all the accessory work in the world, but <strong>Specificity is King</strong>. To unlock the skill, you have to actually practice the skill. This means holding the hardest progression (Tuck, Advanced Tuck, etc.) that you can manage for <strong>3 to 5 seconds</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bands:</strong> Once you hit your max hold, use resistance bands to assist you in a harder progression to build the "feeling" of the full move. This helps your brain understand the balance required.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sample Planche Training Schedule</h2>
        <p>Because of the intensity, don't train planche every day. A common mistake is overtraining the tendons. Try this twice a week:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Skill Work:</strong> 5 sets of your max hold (3-5 seconds).</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Builder:</strong> 3 sets of Planche Leans (max lean for 10-15 seconds).</li>
            <li><strong>Accessory:</strong> 3 sets of Zanetti Press (8-12 reps).</li>
        </ul>

            <h2 style="border:none; margin-top:0;">Planche FAQ</h2>
            
            <span class="faq-q">Why do my wrists hurt during leans?</span>
            <p>You are likely lacking wrist extension mobility. Try turning your hands slightly outward (45 degrees) or using <strong>Parallettes</strong> to keep your wrists in a neutral position while you build up the necessary flexibility.</p>

            <span class="faq-q">Should I lock my elbows completely?</span>
            <p>Yes. A planche with bent elbows is technically a "pseudo-planche push-up" hold. True planche strength is built through locked elbows, which forces the load onto the biceps tendon and anterior deltoid.</p>

            <span class="faq-q">How long does it take to get a Full Planche?</span>
            <p>For most athletes, a Full Planche takes 2 to 5 years of consistent, specific training. It is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on mastering the Advanced Tuck first.</p>

            <span class="faq-q">Can I train Planche and Front Lever on the same day?</span>
            <p>Yes, many athletes use a "Full Body" skill approach. Since Planche is a push and Front Lever is a pull, they don't directly compete for the same muscle groups, though they both tax the Central Nervous System (CNS).</p>
        </section>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Critical Warning:</strong> Planche training is extremely taxing on the joints. If your elbows feel weak or painful, <strong>do not attempt these for at least a week</strong>. Also, do not jump into straight-arm work if you haven't mastered your basic push-up and dip numbers yet. Build the base, then build the skill.
